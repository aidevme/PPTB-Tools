## Development Setup

Checkout [TOOLBOX_DEV.md](TOOLBOX_DEV.md) for more information.

## Coding Standards

-   Use TypeScript for all new code
-   Follow existing code style and conventions
-   Add comments for complex logic
-   Use meaningful variable and function names
-   Keep functions small and focused

## TypeScript Guidelines

-   Enable strict mode
-   Avoid using `any` when possible
-   Define interfaces for complex objects
-   Export types that may be used by tools

## Branch Naming Convention

Use the following prefixes for branch names:

-   `dev/` - For work targeting the shared **dev** branch (e.g., `dev/nightly-fixes`)
-   `feat/` - For new features (e.g., `feat/add-connection-export`)
-   `fix/` - For bug fixes (e.g., `fix/tool-loading-error`)
-   `docs/` - For documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-api-guide`)
-   `refactor/` - For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/tool-manager`)
-   `chore/` - For maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)
-   `test/` - For test additions or updates (e.g., `test/add-unit-tests`)

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

Examples:

-   `feat: add connection export functionality`
-   `feat(tools): add tool verification system`
-   `fix: resolve tool loading error on startup`
-   `fix(connections): handle invalid connection URLs`
-   `docs: update README with new API examples`
-   `docs(api): add missing type definitions`
-   `style: format code according to ESLint rules`
-   `refactor: restructure tool manager for better maintainability`
-   `refactor(auth): simplify authentication flow`
-   `test: add unit tests for settings manager`
-   `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
-   `chore(build): update TypeScript configuration`

**Types:**

-   `feat` - New features
-   `fix` - Bug fixes
-   `docs` - Documentation changes
-   `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
-   `refactor` - Code refactoring without changing functionality
-   `test` - Test additions or updates
-   `chore` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, build changes
-   `perf` - Performance improvements
-   `ci` - CI/CD changes

## Testing

Currently, we're establishing the testing infrastructure. When adding new features:

1. Consider how it can be tested
2. Manually test your changes
3. Document test scenarios

## Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update README.md if it affects user-facing functionality
2. Update [TOOLBOX_DEV.md](TOOLBOX_DEV.md) for ToolBox related changes
3. Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for architectural changes
4. Add inline code comments for complex logic
5. Update type definitions in `packages/types/` & publish a new version to **npm**

All documentation files are located in the `docs/` directory.

## Release Process

-   PR --> dev branch --> automated nightly pre-release
-   Testing performed on the new changes
-   dev branch --> main branch --> automated release

## Questions?

If you have questions, feel free to:

-   Open an issue for discussion
